# Php Sniplets

after like 25 Years of reusing the same code in like hundreds of projecs, i think its better to make a reusable repro so fixes are provided quicker,
however most of the code has not ben changed in years and just stay as bad as it is for a very long time, maybe this will help to fix those things and maybe makes the code a bit better.

this is supposed to be dirty-include files to be used on multiple platforms and scenarios.
this does come with some challenges as some code may have different approaches to things.

basic structure needs to be defined now as this will be very hard to change later, usually i had a /snip folder that did contain some .inc.php file to be used as require or include.
lets keep that but add some additional folders:
- Html (visible things)
- Net (Inter-server and inter-service related stuff)

- more to come as i gather those things together here
  if you looking for something specific, let me know!
